    <h2>About game</h2>
    <img id="dotal" alt="dota" src="../img/dota/logo3.png">
    <p><strong>Defense of the Ancients (DotA)</strong> is a <strong>multiplayer online battle arena</strong> mod for the video game <strong>Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos</strong> and its expansion, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne. The
        objective of the game is for each team to destroy their opponents' Ancient, a heavily guarded structure at the opposing corner of the map, which is based on the "Aeon of Strife"
        map for StarCraft. Players use powerful units known as heroes, and are assisted by allied teammates and AI-controlled fighters. As in role-playing games, players level up their
        heroes and use gold to buy equipment during the mission.<br><br>
        The scenario was developed with the "World Editor" of Reign of Chaos, and was updated upon the release of its expansion, The Frozen Throne. There have been many variations of
        the original concept, the most popular being <strong>DotA Allstars</strong>, eventually simplified to DotA. The mod has been maintained by several authors during development, with the pseudonymous
        designer, known as IceFrog, maintaining the game since the mid-2000s.<br><br>
        DotA became a feature at several worldwide tournaments, including <strong>Blizzard Entertainment's BlizzCon</strong> and the Asian World Cyber Games. Critical reception to DotA was positive,
        with it being called one of the most popular mods of any game. DotA is largely attributed to being the most significant inspiration for the multiplayer online battle arena genre.
        American video game developer <strong>Valve Corporation</strong> acquired the intellectual property rights to DotA in 2009 to develop a stand-alone sequel, Dota 2, which released in July 2013.
    <p>Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients
    (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne.<br><br> Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams
    of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all
    have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully battle the opposing team's heroes in player
    versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called "The Ancient".</p>
